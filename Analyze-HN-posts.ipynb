    "# HackerNews Post Interactions and Popularity\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will explore a dataset of HackerNews (HN) posts, comparing two types of posts and their popularity on the website; \"Ask HN\" and \"Show HN\" posts. Ask HN posts are user-submitted posts that ask the community a specific question, including personal projects, technical issues, and current events. Show HN posts are submissions that show a project, a product, or other interesting related links.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this project compares these two types to determine:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which of Ask HN or Show HN posts receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do posts created at certain times receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "These data for the analyses are derived from a truncated version of a larger data set of 300,000 posts, wherein the present version consists of 20,000 rows by first removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions."

    "The most popular kind of posts, in terms of average comments per post, were Ask HN posts. For these post-types, the best times to submit were 3PM EST, 2AM EST, and 8PM EST, ordered by most average comments per post. Show HN posts had a different list of top hours to improve chances of post interaction, with the top three times being 6PM EST, 12AM EST, and 2PM EST.\n",
    "\n",
    "It appears that the best hours for user comment interactions would be 2-4PM EST, with Ask HN posts being most likely to generate user comments at 3PM. Following this, there seems to be similarly high user traffic and interaction between 6PM-9PM EST, with Ask HN posts again having the highest average comments per post around 3PM EST.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might be related to the nature of Ask HN posts, which are directly interacting with and engaging the HN community and sourcing content from the users themselves. Show HN on the other hand is providing content to the HN community and attempting to get responses to that. It may be beneficial for posts trying to get the most user interaction through comments to pose Ask HN questions that allow many users to contribute their knowledge, experience, or opinions, rather than aksing more technical questions that require expertise, specialized skills, or niche experiences. On the other hand, these kinds of posts could be generating interest due to the unique questions posed, and further analysis of the content of the most-commented Ask HN posts could investigate this interaction further."
